# HashTable

## Overview
This program is an implementation of an AVL Tree, which is a self-balancing tree data structure.

It includes a test suite as a "Native Unit Test C++ project" and the HashTable itself can run in isolation in C++.

UPDATE: As of Visual Studio 2022, the unit tests are broken but the HashTable implementation still works

### Driver
This program is an implementation of a HashTable.
As far as program input and output, everything is only
for testing the HashTable class and thus the code is
only test code, and requires no input.

#### Input:
None required

#### Output:
The program outputs the results of a simple test where
3 items are added to a hash table and then the titles
are printed using the operator[]. An item is changed
to test passing by reference, then the changed title
is printed. Because the rest of the test code is in
the 'HashTableTest.sln' it suggests the user to look
at the UnitTest code for the rest of the tests.
